# Overview of the statistical analysis:
  - The purpose of the analysis is to analyze temperature data of Hawaii from 2010-2017 to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable year-round. For this analysis I calculated summary statistics of the temperature data for June and December to represent peak season and the off season. 

# Results:
  ### June

  - There are 1700 data points for the month of June in the years 2010-2017 in this dataset
  - The average temperature across all years in June was about 75 degrees
  - The minimum temperature was 64 degrees and the maximum was 85 degrees             
    
  ### December

  - There are 1517 data points for the month of December in the years 2010-2017 in this dataset
  - The average temperature across all years in December was about 71 degrees
  - The minimum temperature was 53 degrees and the maximum was 83 degrees          
 
# Summary:
From my temperature analysis it appears that Hawaii stays relatively the same temperature year round (lower to mid 70s) which would make it a great location for the surf and ice cream shop due to consistently favorable temperature conditions year round.  

-I also investigated the precipitation data for June and December. On average it rains about 0.14 inches in June and 0.22 inches in December. 

-I would suggest investigating this data deeper by only looking at weather data stations within in a certain distance of the proposed location in order to narrow down the temperature and preciiptation data to the area of investiation for the proposed shop.
