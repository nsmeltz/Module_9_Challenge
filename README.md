# Overview of the statistical analysis:
  - The purpose of the analysis is to analyze temperature data of Hawaii from 2010-2017 to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable year-round. For this analysis I calculated summary statistics of the temperature data for June and December to represent peak season and the off season. 

# Results:
  ## June
    - There are 1700 data points for the month of June in the years 2010-2017 in this dataset
    - The average temperature across all years in June was about 75 degrees
    - The minimum temperature was 64 degrees and the maximum was 85 degrees
    
  ## December

# Summary:
  - There is a high-level summary of the results 
  - two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December
